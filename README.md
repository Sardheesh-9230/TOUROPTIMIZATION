The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) aims to find the shortest route that visits each city once and returns to the starting city. This challenge can be addressed using the Nearest Neighbor and 2-opt algorithms. The Nearest Neighbor algorithm constructs an initial tour by starting from a given city and repeatedly selecting the nearest unvisited city until all cities are included. To improve this initial tour, the 2-opt algorithm iteratively examines pairs of edges and swaps them if the swap results in a shorter tour, thereby refining the route. The implementation involves representing the distances between cities using a graph data structure, creating an initial tour with the Nearest Neighbor algorithm, and optimizing it with the 2-opt algorithm. Dynamic memory allocation is utilized to manage city data and tour sequences efficiently. This combination of algorithms offers a practical solution to the TSP, quickly generating an initial solution and then refining it to achieve a shorter overall tour length
