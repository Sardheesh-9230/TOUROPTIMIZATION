Tour Optimization
Overview
Tour Optimization is a project aimed at solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The goal is to find the shortest route that visits each destination once and returns to the starting point. Tour Otimization implements the Nearest Neighbor algorithm to generate an initial solution and the 2-opt algorithm to optimize it further.

Features
Efficient route generation using graph data structures.
Implementation of Nearest Neighbor Algorithm for initial path creation.
Optimization of routes with the 2-opt Algorithm.
Support for random or user-defined destinations.
Interactive command-line interface.
Algorithms Used
Nearest Neighbor Algorithm: Quickly generates an initial solution by visiting the closest unvisited destination.
2-opt Algorithm: Optimizes the initial route by iteratively swapping edges to shorten the total path distance.
Requirements
C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
Basic knowledge of command-line operation
